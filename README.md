This file contains a synthetic dataset designed for engine failure detection in mechanical systems, particularly in the automotive industry. It includes various sensor readings and operational parameters collected during both normal and faulty engine states. The data is simulated to reflect different fault conditions ranging from normal operation to severe engine faults.
